Optimal Grid-Battery Power Allocation for Time-Energy-Sensitive Wireless Systems

We provide a grid-battery-powered base station environment and a virtual-battery value iteration algorithm to validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the algorithm's efficiency.

We will release the remaining code soon after the paper is accepted.
